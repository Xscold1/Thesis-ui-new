            <p className="indent__2">We abide by and uphold user data privacy rights in accordance with Republic
                Act 10173, or the Data Privacy Act of 2012. The information gathered won't be
                misused, maliciously disclosed, or improperly disposed of. We make every

            <p className="indent__2">We do not sell your Personal Information, and we do not share it with any
                third party for promotional purposes. DOH will receive some Personal
                Information to help them with data analytics. The DOH will use the data to
                look for correlations and trends, identify the areas with high morbidity rates
                for lung disease, and learn about the diseaseâ€™s seasonality. It will help health
                officials to become aware of and target the areas where and when lung
                disease is most prevalent in their community.

            <p className="indent__1"><strong className="strong">5. Security</strong></p>
            <p className="indent__2">We value the security of your Personal Information. To protect the Personal
                Information given to us, we adhere to generally established industry standards
                both during transmission and after the reception. For example, we have a
                login system to make sure that authorized persons only have access to the
                system data. We also used token-based authentication to have a digital
                signature of the authenticated user which is being passed and validated in the
                back-end, which protects all API endpoints from unwanted access. We also
                use famous, secure, and trusted web hosting to handle the deployment of the
                site. We also adhere to the best security standards during development to
                guarantee that data is safely kept, managed, and processed. If there is a data
                breach, we have security countermeasures in place.

            <p className="indent__1"><strong className="strong">6. Storage, Correction, and Deletion of Information</strong></p>
            <p className="indent__2">We keep data for as long as it is required to offer you and others services. Your
                account information will be maintained until your account is deleted. You
                have the option to delete your account at any moment. Since we archive data
                on a regular basis, it can be kept indefinitely, even after deletion. To modify or
                complete your account information, you can access and update your account
                settings at any time.
